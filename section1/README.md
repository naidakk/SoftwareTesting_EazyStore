# WELCOME TO THE JAVA FULLSTACK DEVELOPER COURSE üìö

A **Fullstack Developer** is a software professional skilled in both **frontend** and **backend** development.  
They build complete applications‚Äîfrom designing user interfaces to writing server-side logic and managing databases.

üëâ In modern companies, Fullstack Developers are highly valued because they can work across the entire application lifecycle‚Äîfrom **concept to production**.

- Simple, read-only websites with no interactivity.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic Websites (Early 2000s)**
- Added interactivity with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, ASP.NET, JSP**.
- Connected to databases like **MySQL**.
- Supported forms, user logins, and content management.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **AJAX & jQuery Revolution (Mid-2000s)**
- **AJAX** and **jQuery** introduced more dynamic, real-time interactions.
- Websites became smoother and more responsive.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Single Page Applications (2010s)**
- Emergence of **SPAs** using frameworks like **Angular, React, Vue.js**.
- Provided app-like experiences in the browser.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Fullstack Applications (Modern Era)**
- Today‚Äôs applications use **React (frontend)**, **Spring Boot (backend)**, and **MySQL (database)**.
- These technologies power the **Fullstack Development** which we‚Äôll learn in this course.

## Creating a Hello World App with React & Vite

### Step 1: Install Node.js

- React and Vite require Node.js to run.

- Go to [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

- Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version (recommended for most users).

- Install it using the installer.

- Verify installation in the terminal:

``` 
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see versions like:
```
node: v20.5.0
npm: 10.3.0
```
### Step 2: Create a React project using Vite

Vite is a modern build tool that‚Äôs faster than create-react-app.

Open your terminal and run:

```
npm create vite@latest
```
You will be prompted for:

- Project name: e.g., hello-world

- Framework: choose React

- Variant: choose JavaScript (or TypeScript if you want TS)

Go into the project folder:
```
cd hello-world
```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
### Step 3: Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```

You should see output like:
```

  VITE v4.x.x  ready in 300ms

  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ‚ûú  Network: use --host to expose
  ```
Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser, and you should see your React app running.


### Step 4: Create a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Component

Open src/App.jsx (or src/App.js).

Replace its content with:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World from React + Vite!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Save the file, and your browser should automatically refresh showing Hello World from React + Vite!

‚úÖ And that‚Äôs it! You now have a running React app using Vite.

## Downloading IntelliJ IDEA

To start working with Java or other languages, you need an IDE.  
We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) by JetBrains.

### Steps to Download:

-  Click the link above to go to the IntelliJ IDEA download page.
- Choose your operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Select the edition:
    - **Community Edition** ‚Äì Free, good for most projects.
    - **Ultimate Edition** ‚Äì Paid, includes advanced features for web and enterprise development.
- Download and run the installer.
- Follow the installation instructions on your OS.
- Once installed, launch IntelliJ IDEA and configure your JDK if prompted.

## Hello World Spring Boot App

To create a simple Spring Boot application that prints "Hello World", follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) installed
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Community or Ultimate Edition)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (optional, IntelliJ can handle Maven automatically)

---

### Steps to Create the App

1. **Create a Spring Boot Project:**
    - Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
    - Project: Maven Project
    - Language: Java
    - Spring Boot: Latest stable version
    - Dependencies: Spring Web
    - Click **Generate**, download the zip, and extract it.

2. **Open in IntelliJ IDEA:**
    - Open IntelliJ ‚Üí `File ‚Üí Open` ‚Üí Select the extracted folder.
    - Wait for IntelliJ to import the project and resolve dependencies.

3. **Create a HelloController:**
   Inside `src/main/java/com/example/demo`, create a new Java class called `HelloController.java`:

   ```java
   package com.example.demo;

   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

   @RestController
   public class HelloController {

       @GetMapping("/hello")
       public String hello() {
           return "Hello World from Spring Boot!";
       }
   }

4. Run the Application:

- Run the main class DemoApplication.java (generated by Spring Initializr)

- Spring Boot will start on port 8080 by default.

5. Test the App:

- Open your browser or Postman and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/hello
```

You should see:
```
Hello World from Spring Boot!
```

# Library vs Framework

When developing software, you will often hear about **libraries** and **frameworks**. Both help you reuse code, but they differ in **control** and **structure**.

---

## Library
- A collection of reusable code designed to perform specific tasks (e.g., manipulating strings, handling HTTP requests, working with dates).
- You **call the library's methods/functions** directly from your code.
- Offers **flexibility** ‚Äî you choose which parts to use and when.
- Typically easier to learn since you only need to understand the functions you plan to use.
- Best suited for **modular tasks** where control remains with the developer.
- **Examples:**
    - React (JavaScript)
    - Lombok (Java)
    - TensorFlow (Python)

---

## Framework
- Provides a **foundation and architecture** for building software applications.
- Follows the principle of **Inversion of Control (IoC)** ‚Äî the framework calls your code, not the other way around.
- Frameworks **impose structure** ‚Äî you follow predefined rules and flow.
- Often has a **steeper learning curve** because it requires understanding the entire architecture.
- Best suited for **large-scale, complex applications** where consistency and structure are critical.
- **Examples:**
    - Angular (JavaScript)
    - Spring Boot (Java)
    - Django (Python)

## Key Difference

| Aspect          | Library                         | Framework                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Control         | You call the library            | Framework calls your code          |
| Structure       | Flexible, optional              | Prescribes structure               |
| Learning Curve  | Easier to learn                 | Steeper, requires architecture     |
| Best Use Case   | Modular, flexible tasks         | Large-scale, structured apps       |
| Examples        | React, Lombok, TensorFlow       | Angular, Spring Boot, Django       |
